Code for my NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Submission

Directions:
Download and run in order to see the results of the code. All data pertaining to this
code needs to be downloaded first and put in the same directory, or you can change
the file pointers.

Personal Disclosure:
This is my first large data analytics project I've ever done. I'm still a college
student, so this is me trying to gain experience in the data analytics/machine
learning world. That being said, this code is not perfectly organized. I'm still
working on the best way to format all code that I write and use, so it may seem a
little l bit all over the place. 

Feel free to reach out with any questions!
